Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------

For this project, I have decided to use the Life Expectancy Data provided from the World Health Orgination and United Nation. Over the years, it is clear that there has been a huge development in the health sector and as a result life expectancies in many countries have gone to increase. With this data set, we are able to bring to light the improvement of health and social issues within developing countries as well to truly reflect whether improvements have been made. These statistics span from the years of 2000-2015 concentrating on the data of over 193 countries. The data provides information on 22 different variables, varying from social, economical, and morality factors. In order to determine a smaller sample of the enourmous data set, I have sorted the variables out to get a more precise view into what I want to study. To begin with I applied two filters, I wanted to look at developing countries and their statistics in the 2015 year for the most recent information; I found that out of the 193 countries provided, only 153 were developing countries. In order to choose a randomized sample, I put the 153 countries(Before 50) into an excel sheet and randomized their order using the RAND() function. Once this was done, the information was sorted and the first 50 elements(STA218_data) were taken into consideration. You can find the following CSV file at the link provided below, along with more information regarding the data source:
